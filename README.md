# api-books
 refactoring of technical test for entry as a backend developer with nestJs

This is an only test, so, to use this, you can try with the follow user:

{
  "username": "user4",
  "password": "pass4#"
}

the endpoints that the project has are these:

GET /hello
GET /books
GET /books/{bookId}
GET /books?price={price}
GET /books?phrase={phrase}
GET /books/average
POST /books  

try this API with postman or implement an front to show the responses!
